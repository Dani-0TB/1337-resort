An Odin Project Student Exercise By Dani

## What is this?

This is the project repo for a landing page exercise using CSS to style a landing page. It is based on a reference image of the final layout plus some styles, which are included in images/references, this come from TOP.  

### Why LEET?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet):

> "Leet (or "1337"), also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet. It often uses character replacements in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many dialects or linguistic varieties in different online communities.
>
> The term "leet" is derived from the word elite, used as an adjective to describe skill or accomplishment especially in the fields of online gaming and computer hacking. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as 1337 or leet."

So it's just some programmer lingo I kinda like, and I've decided it will stand for:  

**"Leading Edge Engineering Technology Resort**. LEET Resort!
